# Edge-Digit-Classification
This repository contains an Android application that captures handwritten digit images, divides them into four parts, and distributes these parts to four different client mobile devices. The distributed images are then classified using pre-trained deep learning models, and the results are consolidated on the master mobile device.

# # Objective
The primary objective of this project is to create an Android application for edge computing that demonstrates the following functionalities:

* Capture images of handwritten digits.
Divide captured images into four parts.
Distribute these parts to four different mobile devices (one master and three clients).
Classify the handwritten digits on each client using pre-trained deep learning models.
Consolidate the results on the master mobile device.
Organize the classified digits into their respective folders on the master mobile.
